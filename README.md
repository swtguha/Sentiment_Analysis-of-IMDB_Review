# Sentiment_Analysis-of-IMDB_Review
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM for Binary Text Classification
**Overview**
This project implements an LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for binary text classification. Designed for tasks such as sentiment analysis, the model processes text data by leveraging LSTM units to capture contextual information and long-term dependencies.

**Key Features**
Data Processing: Includes tokenization, padding, and text embedding.

Model Architecture: Utilizes an embedding layer followed by LSTM units and a dense output layer for binary classification.

Evaluation: Assessed with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Dataset
IMDB Movie Reviews: Used for training and evaluating the sentiment classification model.
How to Use
Install dependencies: tensorflow, numpy, scikit-learn.
Prepare and preprocess data.
Train the model and evaluate its performance.
